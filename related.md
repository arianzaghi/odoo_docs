A Related Field is not a relational field per se; no relationship is created between models. It uses an existing relationship to fetch and display information from another record.

> [!Example]
To display the email address of a customer on the _Sales Order_ model, use the Related Field `partner_id.email` by selecting Customer and then Email.
